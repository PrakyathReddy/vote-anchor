# vote-anchor

In this program, we are going to take some content from the internet - any url or any content. We are going to hash that content, and create a unique account for that content and people are going to be able to upvote or downvote on that content in a completely decentralized way.

We are going to have 3 functions:
1. Initialize
2. Upvote
3. Downvote
